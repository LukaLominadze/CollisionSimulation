Collision Simulation made with my OpenGL Renderer (https://github.com/LukaLominadze/GLRenderer) in C++ featuring
- Multiple simulations with different algorithms (Brute Force, Space Partitioning, Quad Tree)
- Camera controls (Move, zoom)
- Visualization of the underlying algorithm (Gizmos)
- Pausing simulation
